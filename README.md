## Introduction

URLAutoSplicer is a simple Chrome Extension, which redirects you to self-constructed URL instantly with context selection.

The initial idea of URLAutoSplicer comes from my former tool [Tieba Service Caller](https://github.com/crisp-archive/chrome_tieba_service_caller). It allows developers to call API with context selection when they are developing and debugging.
